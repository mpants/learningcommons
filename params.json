What kind of learning can we participate in if we can't afford college, because of money or time?  How can our community serve as a source of learning and accreditation, leading to better self-reliance, confidence, employment, and collaboration?  \r\n\r\nVersion 1 of this site is simply an attempt to aggregate local sources of learning in a community and allow members of the community to post their own.  Meant to serve as a local portal for learning.   Ideally, if it's completed, it will be deployable in other communities.\r\n\r\nThis version originates in Carrboro-Durham, NC, and is inspired by conversations with Jacob Levin at Weaver Street Market.  \r\n\r\nThank you to all sentient beings.","google":"UA-40638668-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
